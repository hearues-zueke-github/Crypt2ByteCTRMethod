# Crypt2ByteCTRMethod

## Intro
First of all this en/decryption method is inspired by the symmetrical encryption methods like DES, AES etc.
But the algorithm for the encryption is a little other.

### S-Box or the mapping function
For understanding, how the encryption is working, I will make a simple example.
Let say we have a given plain text in 2 Bits:
| 01 10 01 11 10 01 11 00 |
| --- |
